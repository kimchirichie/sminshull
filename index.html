								At Scarsin Corporation, I quickly learned to effectively use their software,
								Integrated Insight Environment (I2E). Within a week of being trained in this
								advanced Microsoft-integrated software, I was developing a comprehensive
								introductory instructional guide for client education. In addition, I worked
							  diligently on constructing, refining and reviewing financial reports that required
						  	extreme precision and attention to data integrity. Constantly juggling building
						  	multiple clients’ reports and manager tasks, I delivered impressive work and met
						  	all deadlines.  Multi-tasking, while working on complex, multi-level projects and
						  	delivering on deadline, is a task I excel at.

								clear and concise way. This high-energy, entrepreneurial environment required me
								to multi-task constantly; I excelled at precision in balancing cash, honing

								and creating effective store displays and managing shipping/receiving.
								With respect for resources, efficiency of processes was always my goal.

								I am insatiably curious.  I strive to move toward new learning opportunities.
								And so I joined the Hydroponics Team!  After completing  a significant independent
								study into the construction and variations between hydropic systems as well as
								their benefits, I collaborated to create the layout and material choices for
								the mobile hydroponics unit.  This research is ongoing.

					<h3>Waterloo Undergraduate Nanotechnology Conference, First Annual</h3>

							<p>
								After being chosen through a competitive application process to attend this
								conference of nanotechnology research and industry experts, I participated
								in an innovative "Think-a-thon" where I presented my results to my group.
								One speaker specifically inspired me to consider a new perspective and as a
								result, I re-worked a report immediately following the conference. Every
								opportunity is one to learn.

					<h3>Gold Level National Award Candidate</h3>
					<h5>Duke of Edinburgh Award</h5>

							<p>
								The Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award challenged me to set and achieve goals,
								over 24 months, in five areas: community service (120+ volunteer hours), 
								skills (film-making, language, crafts, concert band playing alto sax), physical 
								recreation, adventurous journeys and a residential project (attending National Music
								Camp of Canada).  I have volunteered in my school and community for many years,
								yet the award criteria challenged me to volunteer in unfamiliar settings and take on
								projects that I was unskilled at (like knitting!). I motivated myself to seek membership
								in the school band even though it was not open to students who were not taking music class.
								I used this award to push myself to become accomplished in areas like pole vaulting,
								hurdling and curling. The final requirement was the adventurous expedition where
								I canoed 60kms into Algonquin Park, camping and carrying all the required supplies!

								Soccer is my passion, my physical outlet. I have participated at all
								levels of soccer (house league to rep) since I was five years old. 
								I have also coached two girls' teams and refereed for four years (Referee 
								of the Year, 2014).   A highlight was training with the Canadian Women’s
								Olympic Soccer Team, summer 2014 as well at attending the Disney World Cup
								(2014) to compete against teams from the U.S.A., South America and Dominican Republic.

								My dedication and determination on the track and on the field saw me rise to
								be a high-level hurdler and pole vaulter during high school. I achieved goals
								from obtaining the Women's Pole Vault record (junior and senior) at my high
								school, to becoming a Provincial Top Ten Pole Vault finisher twice (OFSAA).
								I recently retired with a personal best jump of 3m which gave me a national 
								ranking at Pole Vault Canada as #61.
